\begin{enumerate}[a]
	\item %a
	We came up with the following algorithm which I implemented in Groovy:

	\lstinputlisting{code/findCPathsRecursive.groovy}

	It can be used like this

	\begin{lstlisting}
	int[][] matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 6, 5], [3, 2, 1]]
	println findCPaths(matrix, 12, 2, 2)
	\end{lstlisting}

	which produces the correct result $2$.

	\paragraph{Correctness}

	By taking both a step to the right and a step down at each position, we exhaustively try all possible paths to $M[m][n]$ so we are guaranteed to find the correct solution by summing all paths we find together.

	\paragraph{Time Complexity}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item At each position we visit we make a maximum of $C$ steps, beginning to the right, and a maximum of $C$ step beginning down: $O(2C) = O(C)$.
		\item We visit $m * n * 2C$ positions: $O(mn2C) = O(mnC)$.
	\end{itemize}

	The total time complexity is $O(mnC^2)$. It could drastically improved by dynamic programming as we see below.

	\item %b
	(We did not quite understand this part: "The algorithm should rely on the bottom-up computation of P [i, j, k] in a". What a? Where is a defined? We just found a bottom up algorithm with the correct time complexity.)

	The number of C-paths from $M[0][0]$ to $M[m][n]$ can be computed bottom up by traversing $M$ from top left to bottom right until you reach $M[m][n]$. At each $M[i][j]$ set $V[i][j]$ to the union of $V[i - 1][j]$ with $V[i][j + 1]$ and add the current value to all elements of $V[i][j]$. For every $v \in V[i][j], v = C$ increment $P[i][j][C]$.

	\paragraph{Correctness}

	We can only go right or down so at position $i, j$ we could have only come from $i - 1, j$ or $i, j - 1$. $V[i][j]$ contains all values you could possibly have when you reach point $M[i][j]$. If the values match $C$ then they represent C-paths.

	\paragraph{Time Complexity}

	We visit $mn$ nodes and do a maximum of $C$ word at each (taking union of two lists and adding to each), which means that the total time complexity is $O(mnC)$.

\end{enumerate}

\section{} %3
\begin{enumerate}[a]
	\item %a
	Here is a python implementation of our algorithm:

	\lstinputlisting{code/palindrome_top_down.py}

	\paragraph{Correctness}

	At every step our algorithm find the optimum of all possible steps it can take so it always finds the optimal solution.

	\paragraph{Time Complexity}

	The worst case is that the longest palindrome has length $1$. In this case we look at each letter twice: $O(2n) = O(n)$.
